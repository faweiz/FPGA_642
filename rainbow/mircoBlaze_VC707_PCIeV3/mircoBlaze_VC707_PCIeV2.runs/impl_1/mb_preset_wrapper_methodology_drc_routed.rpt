TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_mb_preset_clk_wiz_1_0 and userclk2 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_mb_preset_clk_wiz_1_0] -to [get_clocks userclk2]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks

The waveform of the user clock txoutclk defined on the transceiver output pin mb_preset_i/axi_pcie_0/inst/comp_axi_enhanced_pcie/comp_enhanced_core_top_wrap/axi_pcie_enhanced_core_top_i/pcie_7x_v2_0_2_inst/pcie_top_with_gt_top.gt_ges.gt_top_i/pipe_wrapper_i/pipe_lane[0].gt_wrapper_i/gtx_channel.gtxe2_channel_i/TXOUTCLK or on the net connected to that pin is not consistent with the transceiver settings. The auto-derived clock period is UNDEFINED and the user-defined clock period is 10.000. The expected clock waveform is computed based on the GT settings and the incoming clock to the transceiver.
